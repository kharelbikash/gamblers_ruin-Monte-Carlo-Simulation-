# gamblers_ruin-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-
Gambler's ruin is a statistical concept.
Gambler starts with a stake (in $) and places $1 fair bets until going broke or reaching a goal (in $). One approach is Monte Carlo simulation. Flip "digital" coins and see what happens.Repeat and compute statistics. This program output number of steps to reach goal while giving stake ,goal and number of attempts.It also output either you get broken or your trails are over.
